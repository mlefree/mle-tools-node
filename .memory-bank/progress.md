## Current Status

The project is currently at version 1.14.0, with recent focus on logger system enhancements, API improvements, and documentation updates. Recent changes include:

### Version 1.14.0 (Current) - 2025-08-11
- **Logger System Enhancements**
  - Refactored Logger format creation into separate methods (createBaseFormat, createConsoleFormat)
  - Implemented dynamic label updating functionality for Logger - labels can now be changed after initialization
  - Improved log formatting with consistent padding for process ID/thread ID and log levels
  - Fixed LoggerFactory setUp method to merge options instead of replacing them, preventing loss of previously set options
  - Updated logstash.conf grok patterns to match the new log format with improved separators
  - Enhanced test:elk script to clean up .gen directory before running ELK setup and verification
  - Updated Logger tests to verify dynamic label functionality and improved test organization
  - Added readLastLogs method to LoggerFactory for centralized log reading functionality
  - Enhanced Logger API with improved method signatures and better path handling

### Version 1.13.6 (Previous)
- **ELK Stack Integration Improvements**
  - Fixed critical index configuration mismatch between Logstash and ILM setup
  - Updated Logstash configuration to use `app-logs` alias instead of dynamic daily indices
  - Resolved Elasticsearch 400 error in log queries due to missing @timestamp mapping
  - Ensured full compatibility between ILM policy (`logs_policy`) and Logstash output patterns
  - Enhanced ELK setup verification script with comprehensive health checks
  - Successfully validated `npm run test:elk` command with all verification steps passing
  - Improved log processing pipeline with proper timestamp handling and field mapping

### Version 1.12.18 (Previous)
- Version bump for internal release

### Version 1.12.17
- Added to the launcher a setWorkerStore hook
- Fixed limit to a large response value (e.g., 10MB -> 50MB)
- Prevented queueLauncher setQueueConcurrency undefined

### Version 1.12.15 - 1.12.16
- Fixed a bug in QueueLauncher.ts where queue names were being removed from the queue list when no parameters were found, preventing future checks on those queues

### Version 1.12.14
- Removed commented-out logger line in Launcher.ts
- Fixed a bug in Launcher.ts by adding a check for threadStrategy when using queueLauncher
- Added '**/*.nolint.*' to the ignorePatterns list in eslint.config.mjs
- Updated bpstatus.json version from 0.0.13 to 0.0.14

### Version 1.12.11
- Moved ts-node from dependencies to devDependencies in package.json
- Refactored Launcher.ts initialization logic to use a switch statement based on threadStrategy
- Fixed a bug in Launcher.ts where directWorker was only initialized when polling was not disabled
- Enhanced Launcher.spec.ts with improved test structure and additional test case

The codebase is stable and all tests are passing. The project is actively maintained with regular updates and bug fixes.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
- Some older components need refactoring to follow current patterns
- Test coverage could be improved in certain areas
- Documentation is being migrated to the Memory Bank system

### Bugs and Limitations
- Redis cache implementation may have performance issues with very large datasets
- Worker threads may not terminate properly in certain edge cases
- Some utility functions lack comprehensive error handling

### Compatibility
- Requires Node.js 12.x or higher
- Some features may not work correctly in older Node.js versions
- TypeScript 4.x or higher is required for development

## Roadmap

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Months)
- Complete Memory Bank documentation
- Dependency audit and updates
- Improve test coverage

### Medium-term (3-6 Months)
- Performance optimization
- Expand worker thread capabilities
- Enhance monitoring tools

### Long-term (6+ Months)
- Consider breaking into smaller, more focused packages
- Explore integration with other ecosystems
- Add support for serverless environments
