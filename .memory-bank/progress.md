## Current Status

The project is currently at version 1.12.3, with a focus on improving CI/CD processes, dependency management, and documentation. Recent changes include:

- Improved CI workflow for more reliable tag pushing
- Updated dependencies to their latest versions
- Started implementing the Memory Bank documentation system

The codebase is stable and all tests are passing. The project is actively maintained with regular updates and bug fixes.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
- Some older components need refactoring to follow current patterns
- Test coverage could be improved in certain areas
- Documentation is being migrated to the Memory Bank system

### Bugs and Limitations
- Redis cache implementation may have performance issues with very large datasets
- Worker threads may not terminate properly in certain edge cases
- Some utility functions lack comprehensive error handling

### Compatibility
- Requires Node.js 12.x or higher
- Some features may not work correctly in older Node.js versions
- TypeScript 4.x or higher is required for development

## Roadmap

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Months)
- Complete Memory Bank documentation
- Dependency audit and updates
- Improve test coverage

### Medium-term (3-6 Months)
- Performance optimization
- Expand worker thread capabilities
- Enhance monitoring tools

### Long-term (6+ Months)
- Consider breaking into smaller, more focused packages
- Explore integration with other ecosystems
- Add support for serverless environments
