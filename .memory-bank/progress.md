## Current Status

The project is currently at version 1.12.11, with a focus on improving code quality, dependency management, and documentation. Recent changes include:

- Removed commented-out logger line in Launcher.ts
- Fixed a bug in Launcher.ts by adding a check for threadStrategy when using queueLauncher
- Added '**/*.nolint.*' to the ignorePatterns list in eslint.config.mjs
- Updated bpstatus.json version from 0.0.13 to 0.0.14

Previous version (1.12.10) changes included:
- Moved ts-node from dependencies to devDependencies in package.json
- Refactored Launcher.ts initialization logic to use a switch statement based on threadStrategy
- Fixed a bug in Launcher.ts where directWorker was only initialized when polling was not disabled
- Enhanced Launcher.spec.ts with improved test structure and additional test case

The codebase is stable and all tests are passing. The project is actively maintained with regular updates and bug fixes.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
- Some older components need refactoring to follow current patterns
- Test coverage could be improved in certain areas
- Documentation is being migrated to the Memory Bank system

### Bugs and Limitations
- Redis cache implementation may have performance issues with very large datasets
- Worker threads may not terminate properly in certain edge cases
- Some utility functions lack comprehensive error handling

### Compatibility
- Requires Node.js 12.x or higher
- Some features may not work correctly in older Node.js versions
- TypeScript 4.x or higher is required for development

## Roadmap

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Months)
- Complete Memory Bank documentation
- Dependency audit and updates
- Improve test coverage

### Medium-term (3-6 Months)
- Performance optimization
- Expand worker thread capabilities
- Enhance monitoring tools

### Long-term (6+ Months)
- Consider breaking into smaller, more focused packages
- Explore integration with other ecosystems
- Add support for serverless environments
