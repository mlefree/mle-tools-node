## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy
- Moved from traditional documentation to the Memory Bank system
- Migrated content from DEVELOPMENT.md to Memory Bank files
- Created developmentExamples.md to preserve valuable examples and specific instructions
- Recommended removing DEVELOPMENT.md as its content has been fully migrated

### Versioning Strategy
- Following semantic versioning
- Using Git tags for version tracking
- Automating version bumping and changelog updates

### Dependency Management
- Balancing between staying current and maintaining stability
- Considering extracting more functionality into separate packages (like mle-tools-configuration)

### Testing Strategy
- Focusing on unit tests with high coverage
- Adding more integration tests for critical components
- Using in-memory Redis for testing cache functionality
